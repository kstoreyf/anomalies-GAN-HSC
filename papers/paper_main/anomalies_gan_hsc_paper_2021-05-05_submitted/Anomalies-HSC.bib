abstract = {We present two statistical techniques for astronomical problems: a star-galaxy separator for the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) and a novel anomaly detection method for cross-matched astronomical datasets. The star-galaxy separator is a statistical classification method which outputs class membership probabilities rather than class labels and allows the use of prior knowledge about the source populations. Deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data from the multiply imaged Stripe 82 region are used to check the results from our classifier, which compares favourably with the UKIDSS pipeline classification algorithm. The anomaly detection method addresses the problem posed by objects having different sets of recorded variables in cross-matched datasets. This prevents the use of methods unable to handle missing values and makes direct comparison between objects difficult. For each source, our method computes anomaly scores in subspaces of the observed feature space and combines them to an overall anomaly score. The proposed technique is very general and can easily be used in applications other than astronomy. The properties and performance of our method are investigated using both real and simulated datasets.},

abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

abstract = {How can we discover objects we did not know existed within the large datasets that now abound in astronomy? We present an outlier detection algorithm that we developed, based on an unsupervised Random Forest. We test the algorithm on more than two million galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and examine the 400 galaxies with the highest outlier score. We find objects which have extreme emission line ratios and abnormally strong absorption lines, objects with unusual continua, including extremely reddened galaxies. We find galaxy-galaxy gravitational lenses, double-peaked emission line galaxies, and close galaxy pairs. We find galaxies with high ionisation lines, galaxies which host supernovae, and galaxies with unusual gas kinematics. Only a fraction of the outliers we find were reported by previous studies that used specific and tailored algorithms to find a single class of unusual objects. Our algorithm is general and detects all of these classes, and many more, regardless of what makes them peculiar. It can be executed on imaging, time-series, and other spectroscopic data, operates well with thousands of features, is not sensitive to missing values, and is easily parallelisable.},

abstract = {Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) is a wide-field imaging camera on the prime focus of the 8.2-m Subaru telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii. A team of scientists from Japan, Taiwan, and Princeton University is using HSC to carry out a 300-night multi-band imaging survey of the high-latitude sky. The survey includes three layers: the Wide layer will cover 1400 deg2 in five broad bands (grizy), with a 5 $\sigma$ point-source depth of r ≈ 26. The Deep layer covers a total of 26 deg 2 in four fields, going roughly a magnitude fainter, while the UltraDeep layer goes almost a magnitude fainter still in two pointings of HSC (a total of 3.5 deg 2 ). Here we describe the instrument, the science goals of the survey, and the survey strategy and data processing. This paper serves as an introduction to a special issue of the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, which includes a large number of technical and scientific papers describing results from the early phases of this survey.},

abstract = {The prevalence of outflow and feedback signatures in active galactic nuclei (AGNs is a major unresolved question which large integral field unit (IFU) surveys now allow to address. In this paper, we present a kinematic analysis of the ionized gas in 2778 galaxies at z ∼ 0.05 observed by Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV (SDSS-IV) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA). Specifically, we measure the kinematics of the [O III] $\lambda$5007 {\AA} emission line in each spatial element and fit multiple Gaussian components to account for possible non-gravitational motions of gas. Comparing the kinematics of the ionized gas between 308 MaNGA-selected AGNs that have been previously identified through emissionline diagnostics and sources not classified as AGN, we find that while 25 per cent of MaNGAselectedAGNshow[ OIII] componentswith emission-linewidths of{\textgreater}500 km s-1 in more than 10 per cent of their spaxels, only 7 per cent of MaNGA non-AGNs show a similar signature. Even the AGNs that do not show nuclear AGN photoionization signatures and that were only identified as AGN based on their larger scale photoionization signatures show similar kinematic characteristics. In addition to obscuration, another possibility is that outflow and mechanical feedback signatures are longer lived than the AGN itself. Our measurements demonstrate that high velocity gas is more prevalent in AGN compared to non-AGN and that outflow and feedback signatures in low-luminosity, low-redshift AGN may so far have been underestimated. We show that higher luminosity MaNGA-selected AGNs are able to drive larger scale outflows than lower luminosity AGN. But estimates of the kinetic coupling efficiencies are {\_}1 per cent and suggest that the feedback signatures probed in this paper are unlikely to have a significant impact on the AGN host galaxies. However, continuous energy injection may still heat a fraction of the cool gas and delay or suppress star formation in individual galaxies even when the AGN is weak.},

@article{Akcay2019,
abstract = {Anomaly detection is a classical problem in computer vision, namely the determination of the normal from the abnormal when datasets are highly biased towards one class (normal) due to the insufficient sample size of the other class (abnormal). While this can be addressed as a supervised learning problem, a significantly more challenging problem is that of detecting the unknown/unseen anomaly case that takes us instead into the space of a one-class, semi-supervised learning paradigm. We introduce such a novel anomaly detection model, by using a conditional generative adversarial network that jointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference of latent space. Employing encoder-decoder-encoder sub-networks in the generator network enables the model to map the input image to a lower dimension vector, which is then used to reconstruct the generated output image. The use of the additional encoder network maps this generated image to its latent representation. Minimizing the distance between these images and the latent vectors during training aids in learning the data distribution for the normal samples. As a result, a larger distance metric from this learned data distribution at inference time is indicative of an outlier from that distribution—an anomaly. Experimentation over several benchmark datasets, from varying domains, shows the model efficacy and superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {With the advent of future big-data surveys, automated tools for unsupervised discovery are becoming ever more necessary. In this work, we explore the ability of deep generative networks for detecting outliers in astronomical imaging datasets. The main advantage of such generative models is that they are able to learn complex representations directly from the pixel space. Therefore, these methods enable us to look for subtle morphological deviations which are typically missed by more traditional moment-based approaches. We use a generative model to learn a representation of expected data defined by the training set and then look for deviations from the learned representation by looking for the best reconstruction of a given object. In this first proof-of-concept work, we apply our method to two different test cases. We first show that from a set of simulated galaxies, we are able to detect {\$}\backslashsim 90\backslash{\%}{\$} of merging galaxies if we train our network only with a sample of isolated ones. We then explore how the presented approach can be used to compare observations and hydrodynamic simulations by identifying observed galaxies not well represented in the models.

abstract = {We investigate the physical nature of blue cores in early-type galaxies through the first multi-wavelength analysis of a serendipitously discovered field blue-nucleated spheroid in the background of the deep ACS/WFC griz multicolor observations of the cluster Abell 1689. The resolved g − r, r − i and i − z color maps reveal a prominent blue core identifying this galaxy as a "typical" case study, exhibiting variations of 0.5 − 1.0 mag in color between the center and the outer regions, opposite to the expectations of reddened metallicity induced gradients in passively evolved ellipticals. From a Magellan-Clay spectrum we secure the galaxy redshift at z = 0.624. We find a strong X-ray source coincident with the spheroid galaxy. Spectral features and a high X-ray luminosity indicate the presence of an AGN in the galaxy. However, a comparison of the X-ray luminosity to a sample derived from the Chandra Deep Field South displays L X to be comparable to Type I/QSO galaxies while the optical flux is consistent with a normal star-forming galaxy. We conclude that the galaxy's non-thermal component dominates at high-energy wavelengths while we associate the spheroid blue light with the stellar spectrum of normal star-forming galaxies. We argue about a probable association between the presence of blue cores in spheroids and AGN activity.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the Universe has progressed through deliberate, targeted studies of known phenomena, like the supernova campaigns that enabled the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, as much as through serendipitous, unexpected discoveries. The discovery of the Jovian moons, and of interstellar objects like 1I/'Oumuamua forced us to rethink the framework through which we explain the Universe and develop new theories. Recent surveys, like the Catalina Realtime-Transient Survey and the Zwicky Transient Facility, and upcoming ones, like the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, explore the parameter space of astrophysical transients at all time scales, from hours to years, and offer the opportunity to discover new, unexpected phenomena. In this paper, we investigate strategies to identify novel objects and to contextualize them within large time-series data sets to facilitate the discovery of new objects, new classes of objects, and the physical interpretation of their anomalous nature. We compare tree-based and manifold-learning algorithms for anomaly detection as they are applied to a data set of light curves from the Kepler observatory that include the bona fide anomalous Boyajian's star. We assess the impact of pre-processing and feature engineering schemes and investigate the astrophysical nature of the objects that our models identify as anomalous by augmenting the Kepler data with $\backslash$emph{\{}Gaia{\}} color and luminosity information. We find that multiple models, used in combination, are a promising strategy to not only identify novel time series but also to find objects that share phenomenological and astrophysical characteristics with them, facilitating the interpretation of their anomalous characteristics.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is a significant and hence well-studied problem. However, developing effective anomaly detection methods for complex and high-dimensional data remains a challenge. As Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are able to model the complex high-dimensional distributions of real-world data, they offer a promising approach to address this challenge. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection method, Adversarially Learned Anomaly Detection (ALAD) based on bi-directional GANs, that derives adversarially learned features for the anomaly detection task. ALAD then uses reconstruction errors based on these adversarially learned features to determine if a data sample is anomalous. ALAD builds on recent advances to ensure data-space and latent-space cycle-consistencies and stabilize GAN training, which results in significantly improved anomaly detection performance. ALAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of image and tabular datasets while being several hundred-fold faster at test time than the only published GAN-based method.},

abstract = {We present and characterize the catalog of galaxy shape measurements that will be used for cosmological weak lensing measurements in the Wide layer of the first year of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. The catalog covers an area of 136.9 deg 2 split into six fields, with a mean i-band seeing of 0.58 ′′ and 5$\sigma$ point-source depth of i ∼ 26. Given conservative galaxy selection criteria for first year science, the depth and excellent image quality results in unweighted and weighted source number densities of 24.6 and 21.8 arcmin −2 , respectively. We define the requirements for cosmological weak lensing science with this catalog, then focus on characterizing potential systematics in the catalog using a series of internal null tests for problems with point-spread function (PSF) modeling, shear estimation, and other aspects of the image processing. We find that the PSF models narrowly meet requirements for weak lens-ing science with this catalog, with fractional PSF model size residuals of approximately 0.003 (requirement: 0.004) and the PSF model shape correlation function $\rho$ 1 {\textless} 3 × 10 −7 (requirement: 4 × 10 −7) at 0.5 • scales. A variety of galaxy shape-related null tests are statistically consistent with zero, but star-galaxy shape correlations reveal additive systematics on on {\textgreater} 1 • scales that are sufficiently large as to require mitigation in cosmic shear measurements. Finally, we discuss the dominant systematics and the planned algorithmic changes to reduce them in future data reductions.},

abstract = {We present the first evidence that adaptive learning techniques can boost the discovery of unusual objects within astronomical light curve data sets. Our method follows an active learning strategy where the learning algorithm chooses objects which can potentially improve the learner if additional information about them is provided. This new information is subsequently used to update the machine learning model, allowing its accuracy to evolve with each new information. For the case of anomaly detection, the algorithm aims to maximize the number of scientifically interesting anomalies presented to the expert by slightly modifying the weights of a traditional Isolation Forest (IF) at each iteration. In order to demonstrate the potential of such techniques, we apply the Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) algorithm to 2 data sets: simulated light curves from the PLAsTiCC challenge and real light curves from the Open Supernova Catalog. We compare the AAD results to those of a static IF. For both methods, we performed a detailed analysis for all objects with the {\~{}}2{\%} highest anomaly scores. We show that, in the real data scenario, AAD was able to identify {\~{}}80$\backslash${\%} more true anomalies than the IF. This result is the first evidence that AAD algorithms can play a central role in the search for new physics in the era of large scale sky surveys.},

abstract = {We present a new, and we believe arguably correct, algorithm for producing Red-Green-Blue (RBG) composites from 3-band astronomical images. Our method ensures that an object with a specified astronomical color (e.g. g − r and r − i) has a unique color in the RGB image, as opposed to the burnt-out white stars to which we are accustomed. A natural consequence of this is that we can use the same colors to code color-magnitude diagrams, providing a natural 'index' to our images. We also introduce the use of an asinh stretch, which allows us to show faint objects while simultaneously preserving the structure of brighter objects in the field, such as the spiral arms of large galaxies. We believe that, in addition to their aesthetic value, our images convey far more information than do the traditional ones, and provide examples from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging, the Hubble Deep Field (HDF), and Chandra to support our claims.

abstract = {Collisions and interactions between gas-rich galaxies are thought to be pivotal stages in their formation and evolution, causing the rapid production of new stars, and possibly serving as a mechanism for fueling supermassive black holes (BH). Harnessing the exquisite spatial resolution (∼0.5 arcsec) afforded by the first ∼170 deg 2 of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, we present our new constraints on the importance of galaxy-galaxy major mergers (1:4) in growing BHs throughout the last ∼8 Gyrs. Utilizing mid-infrared observations in the WISE All-Sky survey, we robustly select active galactic nuclei (AGN) and mass-matched control galaxy samples, totaling ∼140,000 spectroscopically confirmed systems at i {\textless} 22 mag. We identify galaxy interaction signatures using a novel machine-learning random forest decision tree technique allowing us to select statistically significant samples of major-mergers, minor-mergers/irregular-systems, and non-interacting galaxies. We use these samples to show that galaxies undergoing mergers are a factor ∼ 2 − 7 more likely to contain luminous obscured AGN than non-interacting galaxies, and this is independent of both stellar mass and redshift to z {\textless} 0.9. Furthermore, based on our comparison of AGN fractions in mass-matched samples, we determine that the most luminous AGN population (L AGN 10 45 erg s −1) systematically reside in merging systems over non-interacting galaxies. Our findings show that galaxy-galaxy interactions do, on average, trigger luminous AGN activity substantially more often than in secularly evolving non-interacting galaxies, and we further suggest that the BH growth rate may be closely tied to the dynamical time of the merger system.},

abstract = {It is clear from stellar evolution and from observations of WR stars that massive stars are releasing metal-enriched gas through their stellar winds in the Wolf-Rayet phase. Although HII region spectra serve as diagnostics to determine the present-day chemical composition of the interstellar medium, it is far from being understood to what extent the HII gas is already contaminated by chemically processed stellar wind. Therefore, we analyzed our models of radiative and wind bubbles of an isolated 85 M{\textperiodcentered} star with solar metallicity (Kr{\"{o}}ger et al. 2006, A{\&}A, in preparation) with respect to the chemical enrichment of the circumstellar HII region. Plausibly, the hot stellar wind bubble (SWB) is enriched with 14N during the WN phase and even much higher with 12C and 16O during the WC phase of the star. During the short period that the 85 M{\textperiodcentered} star spends in the WC stage enriched SWB material mixes with warm HII gas of solar abundances and thus enhances the metallicity in the HII region. However, at the end of the stellar lifetime the mass ratios of the traced elements N and O in the warm ionized gas are insignificantly higher than solar, whereas an enrichment of 22{\%} above solar is found for C. Important issues from the presented study comprise a steeper radial gradient of C than O and a decreasing effect of self-enrichment for metal-poor galaxies. {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some AGN interlopers including 8 newly discovered narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low mass galaxies (M{\~{}}10{\^{}}8.5 - 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun) with high star formation rates ({\~{}}10 M{\_}sun/yr), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 {\~{}} 8.7) and low reddening (E(B-V) {\textless} 0.25) and they reside in low density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}-8{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myrs. The few star-forming Peas with HST imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies. They are also similar to high redshift UV-luminous galaxies, e.g., Lyman-break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.},

abstract = {This paper presents the second data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, a wide-field optical imaging survey using the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope. The release includes data from 174 nights of observation through 2018 January. The Wide layer data cover about 300 deg2 in all five broad-band filters (grizy) to the nominal survey exposure (10 min in gr and 20 min in izy). Partially observed areas are also included in the release; about 1100 deg2 is observed in at least one filter and one exposure. The median seeing in the i-band is 0.''6, demonstrating the superb image quality of the survey. The Deep (26 deg2) and UltraDeep (4 deg2) data are jointly processed and the UltraDeep-COSMOS field reaches an unprecedented depth of i ∼ 28 at 5 $\sigma$ for point sources. In addition to the broad-band data, narrow-band data are also available in the Deep and UltraDeep fields. This release includes a major update to the processing pipeline, including improved sky subtraction, PSF modeling, object detection, and artifact rejection. The overall data quality has been improved, but this release is not without problems; there is a persistent deblender problem as well as new issues with masks around bright stars. The user is encouraged to review the issue list before utilizing the data for scientific explorations. All the image products as well as catalog products are available for download.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Astronomical Society of Japan. All rights reserved. The Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) is an 870 megapixel prime focus optical imaging camera for the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. The wide-field corrector delivers sharp images of 0.2 (FWHM) in the HSC-i band over the entire 1.5 diameter field of view. The collimation of the camera with respect to the optical axis of the primary mirror is done with hexapod actuators, the mechanical accuracy of which is a few microns. Analysis of the remaining wavefront error in off-focus stellar images reveals that the collimation of the optical componentsmeets design specifications.While there is a flexure of mechanical components, it also is within the design specification. As a result, the camera achieves its seeing-limited imaging on Maunakea during most of the time; the median seeing over several years of observing is 0.67 (FWHM) in the i band. The sensors use p-channel, fully depleted CCDs of 200$\mu$m thickness (2048 × 4176 15$\mu$m square pixels) and we employ 116 of them to pave the 50 cm diameter focal plane. The minimum interval between exposures is 34 s, including the time to read out arrays, to transfer data to the control computer, and to save them to the hard drive. HSC on Subaru uniquely features a combination of a large aperture, a wide field of view, sharp images and a high sensitivity especially at longer wavelengths, which makes the HSC one of the most powerful observing facilities in the world.},

abstract = {We present the results from the Suzaku satellite of the surrounding region of a galaxy clus-ter, A2744, at z = 0.3. To search for oxygen emission lines from the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), we analyzed X-ray spectra from two northeast regions 2.2–3.3 and 3.3– 4.4 Mpc from the center of the cluster, which offers the first test on the presence of a WHIM near the typical accretion shock radius (∼ 2r 200) predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. For the 2.2–3.3 Mpc region, the spectral fit significantly (99.2{\%} significance) improved when we include O VII and O VIII lines in the spectral model. A comparable WHIM surface bright-ness was obtained in the 3.3–4.4 Mpc region and the redshift of O VIII line is consistent with z = 0.3 within errors. The present results support that the observed soft X-ray emission orig-inated from the WHIM. However, considering both statistical and systematic uncertainties, O VIII detection in the northeast regions was marginal. The surface brightness of the O VIII line in 10 −7 photons cm −2 s −1 arcmin −2 was measured to be 2.7 ± 1.0, 2.1 ± 1.2 for the 2.2–3.3, 3.3– 4.4 Mpc regions, giving the upper limit on the baryon overdensity of $\delta$ = 319({\textless} 443), 283({\textless} 446), respectively. This is comparable with previous observations of cluster outskirts and their the-oretical predictions. The future prospect for WHIM detection using the Athena X-IFU micro-calorimeter is briefly discussed here. In addition, we also derived the ICM temperature distri-bution of A2744 to detect a clear discontinuity at the location of the radio relic. This suggests that the cluster has undergone strong shock heating by mass accretion along the filament.},

abstract = {Nearby dwarf galaxies provide a unique laboratory in which to test stellar population models below Z⊙/2. Such tests are particularly important for interpreting the surprising highionization ultraviolet (UV) line emission detected at z {\textgreater} 6 in recent years. We present HST/COS UV spectra of 10 nearby metal-poor star-forming galaxies selected to show He II emission in SDSS optical spectra. The targets span nearly a dex in gas-phase oxygen abundance (7.8 {\textless} 12 + logO/H {\textless} 8.5) and present uniformly large specific star formation rates (sSFR {\~{}}102 Gyr-1). The UV spectra confirm that metal-poor stellar populations can power extreme nebular emission in high-ionization UV lines, reaching CIII] equivalent widths comparable to those seen in systems at z {\~{}} 6-7. Our data reveal a marked transition in UV spectral properties with decreasing metallicity, with systems below 12 + logO/H ≲ 8.0 (Z/Z⊙ ≲ 1/5) presenting minimal stellar wind features and prominent nebular emission in He II and C IV. This is consistent with nearly an order of magnitude increase in ionizing photon production beyond the He+-ionizing edge relative to H-ionizing flux as metallicity decreases below a fifth solar, well in excess of standard stellar population synthesis predictions. Our results suggest that often-neglected sources of energetic radiation such as stripped binary products and very massive O-stars produce a sharper change in the ionizing spectrum with decreasing metallicity than expected. Consequently, nebular emission in C IV and He II powered by these stars may provide useful metallicity constraints in the reionization era.},

abstract = {Wide-angle photometric surveys of previously uncharted sky areas or wavelength regimes will always bring in unexpected sources whose existence and properties cannot be easily predicted from earlier observations: novelties or even anomalies. Such objects can be efficiently sought for with novelty detection algorithms. Here we present an application of such a method, called one-class support vector machines (OCSVM), to search for anomalous patterns among sources preselected from the mid-infrared AllWISE catalogue covering the whole sky. To create a model of expected data we train the algorithm on a set of objects with spectroscopic identifications from the SDSS DR13 database, present also in AllWISE. OCSVM detects as anomalous those sources whose patterns - WISE photometric measurements in this case - are inconsistent with the model. Among the detected anomalies we find artefacts, such as objects with spurious photometry due to blending, but most importantly also real sources of genuine astrophysical interest. Among the latter, OCSVM has identified a sample of heavily reddened AGN/quasar candidates distributed uniformly over the sky and in a large part absent from other WISE-based AGN catalogues. It also allowed us to find a specific group of sources of mixed types, mostly stars and compact galaxies. By combining the semi-supervised OCSVM algorithm with standard classification methods it will be possible to improve the latter by accounting for sources which are not present in the training sample but are otherwise well-represented in the target set. Anomaly detection adds flexibility to automated source separation procedures and helps verify the reliability and representativeness of the training samples. It should be thus considered as an essential step in supervised classification schemes to ensure completeness and purity of produced catalogues.},

Of these, six have outflow components with emission line ratios consistent with AGN ionization. Although black holes have been known to populate the centers of at least a few dwarf galaxies, and indirect evidence of AGN quenching of star formation in dwarfs has begun to surface, our measurements constitute the first direct detection and measurement of AGN impact on the large scale kinematics and gas content in dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we find evidence suggestive of ongoing star formation suppression, possibly regulated by the AGN. Galaxy formation models must therefore be able to account not only for the formation and growth of black holes at the centers of dwarf galaxies, but should also be revised to include AGN as important -- and perhaps dominant -- sources of feedback in low mass galaxies},

abstract = {High redshift quasars (HZQs) with redshifts of z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 6 are so rare that any photometrically-selected sample of sources with HZQ-like colours is likely to be dominated by Galactic stars and brown dwarfs scattered from the stellar locus. It is impractical to reobserve all such candidates, so an alternative approach was developed in which Bayesian model comparison techniques are used to calculate the probability that a candidate is a HZQ, P{\_}q, by combining models of the quasar and star populations with the photometric measurements of the object. This method was motivated specifically by the large number of HZQ candidates identified by cross-matching the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS) to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS): in the {\~{}}1900 deg{\^{}}2 covered by the LAS in the UKIDSS Seventh Data Release (DR7) there are {\~{}}10{\^{}}3 real astronomical point-sources with the measured colours of the target quasars, of which only {\~{}}10 are expected to be HZQs. Applying Bayesian model comparison to the sample reveals that most sources with HZQ-like colours have P{\_}q {\textless}{\~{}} 0.1 and can be confidently rejected without the need for any further observations. In the case of the UKIDSS DR7 LAS, there were just 88 candidates with P{\_}q {\textgreater}= 0.1; these object were prioritized for reobservation by ranking according to P{\_}q (and their likely redshift, which was also inferred from the photometric data). Most candidates were rejected after one or two (moderate depth) photometric measurements by recalculating P{\_}q using the new data. That left seven confirmed HZQs, three of which were previously identified in the SDSS and four of which were new UKIDSS discoveries. The high efficiency of this Bayesian selection method suggests that it could usefully be extended to other HZQ surveys (e.g. searches by Pan-STARRS or VISTA) as well as to other searches for rare objects.},

abstract = {Narrow-line regions excited by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are important for studying AGN photoionization and feedback. Their strong [OIII] lines can be detected with broad-band images, allowing morphological studies of these systems with large-area imaging surveys. We develop a new broad-band imaging technique to reconstruct the images of the [OIII] line, using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey aided with spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The technique involves a careful subtraction of the galactic continuum to isolate emission from the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 and [O III]$\lambda$4959 lines. Compared to traditional targeted observations, this technique is more efficient at covering larger samples without dedicated observational resources. We apply this technique to an SDSS spectroscopically selected sample of 300 obscured AGN at redshifts 0.1-0.7, uncovering extended emission-line region candidates with sizes up to tens of kpc. With the largest sample of uniformly derived narrow-line region sizes, we revisit the narrow-line region size-luminosity relation. The area and radii of the [OIII] emission-line regions are strongly correlated with the AGN luminosity inferred from the mid-infrared (15 $\mu$m rest frame) with a power-law slope of 0.62 -0.06+0.05 ± 0.10 (statistical and systematic errors), consistent with previous spectroscopic findings. We discuss the implications for the physics of AGN emission-line regions and future applications of this technique, which should be useful for current and next-generation imaging surveys to study AGN photoionization and feedback with large statistical samples.},

abstract = {Advances in astronomy are often driven by serendipitous discoveries. As survey astronomy continues to grow, the size and complexity of astronomical data bases will increase, and the ability of astronomers to manually scour data and make such discoveries decreases. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based method to identify anomalies in large data sets to facilitate such discoveries, and apply this method to long cadence light curves from NASA's Kepler Mission. Our method clusters data based on density, identifying anomalies as data that lie outside of dense regions. This work serves as a proof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the Kepler long cadence light curves. We use Kepler's most notorious anomaly, Boyajian's star (KIC 8462852), as a rare ‘ground truth' for testing outlier identification to verify that objects of genuine scientific interest are included among the identified anomalies. We evaluate the method's ability to identify known anomalies by identifying unusual behaviour in Boyajian's star; we report the full list of identified anomalies for these quarters, and present a sample subset of identified outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects that are rare in the Kepler field, and data artefacts. By identifying {\textless}4 per cent of each quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection method can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel phenomena.},

abstract = {In the upcoming decade large astronomical surveys will discover millions of transients raising unprecedented data challenges in the process. Only the use of the machine learning algorithms can process such large data volumes. Most of the discovered transients will belong to the known classes of astronomical objects. However, it is expected that some transients will be rare or completely new events of unknown physical nature. The task of finding them can be framed as an anomaly detection problem. In this work, we perform for the first time an automated anomaly detection analysis in the photometric data of the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), which serves as a proof of concept for the applicability of these methods to future large scale surveys. The analysis consists of the following steps: 1) data selection from the OSC and approximation of the pre-processed data with Gaussian processes, 2) dimensionality reduction, 3) searching for outliers with the use of the isolation forest algorithm, 4) expert analysis of the identified outliers. The pipeline returned 81 candidate anomalies, 27 (33{\%}) of which were confirmed to be from astrophysically peculiar objects. Found anomalies correspond to a selected sample of 1.4{\%} of the initial automatically identified data sample of ∼2000 objects. Among the identified outliers we recognised superluminous supernovae, non-classical Type Ia supernovae, unusual Type II supernovae, one active galactic nucleus and one binary microlensing event. We also found that 16 anomalies classified as supernovae in the literature are likely to be quasars or stars. Our proposed pipeline represents an effective strategy to guarantee we shall not overlook exciting new science hidden in the data we fought so hard to acquire. All code and products of this investigation are made publicly available ‡.},

abstract = {The volume of data that will be produced by the next generation of astrophysical instruments represents a significant opportunity for making unplanned and unexpected discoveries. Conversely, finding unexpected objects or phenomena within such large volumes of data presents a challenge that may best be solved using computational and statistical approaches. We present the application of a coarse-grained complexity measure for identifying interesting observations in large astronomical data sets. This measure, which has been termed apparent complexity, has been shown to model human intuition and perceptions of complexity. Apparent complexity is computationally efficient to derive and can be used to segment and identify interesting observations in very large data sets based on their morphological complexity. We show, using data from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey, that apparent complexity can be combined with clustering methods to provide an automated process for distinguishing between images of galaxies which have been classified as having simple and complex morphologies. The approach generalizes well when applied to new data after being calibrated on a smaller data set, where it performs better than tested classification methods using pixel data. This generalizability positions apparent complexity as a suitable machine-learning feature for identifying complex observations with unanticipated features.},

We present 41 new definite or probable lens candidates discovered in Data Release 2 of the survey. Using a combined sample of 87 galaxy-scale lenses out to a lens redshift of z L ∼ 0.8, we compare galaxy number counts in lines of sight toward known and newly-discovered lenses in the survey to those of a control sample consisting of random lines of sight. We also compare the local overdensity of lens galaxies to a sample of "twin" galaxies that have a similar redshift and velocity dispersion to test whether lenses lie in different environments from similar non-lens galaxies. We find that lens fields contain higher number counts of galaxies compared to the control fields, but this effect arises from the local environment of the lens. Once galaxies in the lens plane are removed, the lens lines of sight are consistent with the control sample. The local environments of the lenses are overdense compared to the control sample, and are slightly overdense compared to those of the twin sample, although the significance is marginal. There is no significant evidence of the evolution of the local overdensity of lens environments with redshift.},

abstract = {Survey telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Square Kilometre Array will discover billions of static and dynamic astronomical sources. Properly mined, these enormous datasets will likely be wellsprings of rare or unknown astrophysical phenomena. The challenge is that the datasets are so large that most data will never be seen by human eyes; currently the most robust instrument we have to detect relevant anomalies. Machine learning is a useful tool for anomaly detection in this regime. However, it struggles to distinguish between interesting anomalies and irrelevant data such as instrumental artefacts or rare astronomical sources that are simply not of interest to a particular scientist. Active learning combines the flexibility and intuition of the human brain with the raw processing power of machine learning. By strategically choosing specific objects for expert labelling, it minimises the amount of data that scientists have to look through while maximising potential scientific return. Here we introduce Astronomaly: a general anomaly detection framework with a novel active learning approach designed to provide personalised recommendations. Astronomaly can operate on most types of astronomical data, including images, light curves and spectra. We use the Galaxy Zoo dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of Astronomaly, as well as simulated data to thoroughly test our new active learning approach. We find that for both datasets, Astronomaly roughly doubles the number of interesting anomalies found in the first 100 objects viewed by the user. Astronomaly is easily extendable to include new feature extraction techniques, anomaly detection algorithms and even different active learning approaches.

This release includes data taken in the first 1.7yr of observations (61.5 nights), and each of the Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep layers covers about 108, 26, and 4 square degrees down to depths of i ∼ 26.4, ∼26.5, and ∼27.0mag, respectively (5a for point sources). All the layers are observed in five broad bands (grizy), and the Deep and UltraDeep layers are observed in narrow bands as well. We achieve an impressive image quality of 0".6 in the i band in the Wide layer. We show that we achieve 1{\%}-2{\%} point spread function (PSF) photometry (root mean square) both internally and externally (against Pan-STARRS1), and ∼10mas and 40 mas internal and external astrometric accuracy, respectively. Both the calibrated images and catalogs are made available to the community through dedicated user interfaces and database servers.

abstract = {In this work, we investigate the strength and impact of ionized gas outflows within z ∼ 0.04 MaNGA galaxies. We find evidence for outflows in 322 galaxies ({\$}12{\{}{\{}\backslash \backslashrm per\backslash cent{\}}{\}}{\$} of the analysed line-emitting sample), 185 of which show evidence for hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Most outflows are centrally concentrated with a spatial extent that scales sublinearly with Re. The incidence of outflows is enhanced at higher masses, central surface densities, and deeper gravitational potentials, as well as at higher star formation rate (SFR) and AGN luminosity. We quantify strong correlations between mass outflow rates and the mechanical drivers of the outflow of the form {\$}\backslashdot{\{}M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm out{\}} \backslashpropto \backslashrm SFR{\^{}}{\{}0.97{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashdot{\{}M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm out{\}} \backslashpropto L{\_}{\{}\backslashrm AGN{\}}{\^{}}{\{}0.55{\}}{\$}. We derive a master scaling relation describing the mass outflow rate of ionized gas as a function of M⋆, SFR, Re, and LAGN. Most of the observed winds are anticipated to act as galactic fountains, with the fraction of galaxies with escaping winds increasing with decreasing potential well depth. We further investigate the physical properties of the outflowing gas finding evidence for enhanced attenuation in the outflow, possibly due to metal-enriched winds, and higher excitation compared to the gas in the galactic disc. Given that the majority of previous studies have focused on more extreme systems with higher SFRs and/or more luminous AGN, our study provides a unique view of the non-gravitational gaseous motions within ‘typical' galaxies in the low-redshift Universe, where low-luminosity AGN and star formation contribute jointly to the observed outflow phenomenology.},

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only poor samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models with continuous generators. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10 and LSUN bedrooms. †},

We propose AnoGAN, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to learn a manifold of normal anatomical variability, accompanying a novel anomaly scoring scheme based on the mapping from image space to a latent space. Applied to new data, the model labels anomalies, and scores image patches indicating their fit into the learned distribution.

abstract = {Today's Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are large, complex, and affixed with networked sensors and actuators that are targets for cyber-attacks. Conventional detection techniques are unable to deal with the increasingly dynamic and complex nature of the CPSs. On the other hand, the networked sensors and actuators generate large amounts of data streams that can be continuously monitored for intrusion events. Unsupervised machine learning techniques can be used to model the system behaviour and classify deviant behaviours as possible attacks. In this work, we proposed a novel Generative Adversarial Networks-based Anomaly Detection (GAN-AD) method for such complex networked CPSs. We used LSTM-RNN in our GAN to capture the distribution of the multivariate time series of the sensors and actuators under normal working conditions of a CPS. Instead of treating each sensor's and actuator's time series independently, we model the time series of multiple sensors and actuators in the CPS concurrently to take into account of potential latent interactions between them. To exploit both the generator and the discriminator of our GAN, we deployed the GAN-trained discriminator together with the residuals between generator-reconstructed data and the actual samples to detect possible anomalies in the complex CPS. We used our GAN-AD to distinguish abnormal attacked situations from normal working conditions for a complex six-stage Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. Experimental results showed that the proposed strategy is effective in identifying anomalies caused by various attacks with high detection rate and low false positive rate as compared to existing methods.},

abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to {\textless}sup{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},
