abstract = {Anomaly detection is a significant problem faced in several research areas. Detecting and correctly classifying something unseen as anomalous is a challenging problem that has been tackled in many different manners over the years. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the adversarial training process have been recently employed to face this task yielding remarkable results. In this paper we survey the principal GAN-based anomaly detection methods, highlighting their pros and cons. Our contributions are the empirical validation of the main GAN models for anomaly detection, the increase of the experimental results on different datasets and the public release of a complete Open Source toolbox for Anomaly Detection using GANs.},

@article{Margalef-Bentabol2020,
abstract = {With the advent of future big-data surveys, automated tools for unsupervised discovery are becoming ever more necessary. In this work, we explore the ability of deep generative networks for detecting outliers in astronomical imaging datasets. The main advantage of such generative models is that they are able to learn complex representations directly from the pixel space. Therefore, these methods enable us to look for subtle morphological deviations which are typically missed by more traditional moment-based approaches. We use a generative model to learn a representation of expected data defined by the training set and then look for deviations from the learned representation by looking for the best reconstruction of a given object. In this first proof-of-concept work, we apply our method to two different test cases. We first show that from a set of simulated galaxies, we are able to detect {\$}\backslashsim 90\backslash{\%}{\$} of merging galaxies if we train our network only with a sample of isolated ones. We then explore how the presented approach can be used to compare observations and hydrodynamic simulations by identifying observed galaxies not well represented in the models. The code used in this is available at https://github.com/carlamb/astronomical-outliers-WGAN.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Astronomical Society of Japan. All rights reserved. The Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) is an 870 megapixel prime focus optical imaging camera for the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. The wide-field corrector delivers sharp images of 0.2 (FWHM) in the HSC-i band over the entire 1.5 diameter field of view. The collimation of the camera with respect to the optical axis of the primary mirror is done with hexapod actuators, the mechanical accuracy of which is a few microns. Analysis of the remaining wavefront error in off-focus stellar images reveals that the collimation of the optical componentsmeets design specifications.While there is a flexure of mechanical components, it also is within the design specification. As a result, the camera achieves its seeing-limited imaging on Maunakea during most of the time; the median seeing over several years of observing is 0.67 (FWHM) in the i band. The sensors use p-channel, fully depleted CCDs of 200$\mu$m thickness (2048 × 4176 15$\mu$m square pixels) and we employ 116 of them to pave the 50 cm diameter focal plane. The minimum interval between exposures is 34 s, including the time to read out arrays, to transfer data to the control computer, and to save them to the hard drive. HSC on Subaru uniquely features a combination of a large aperture, a wide field of view, sharp images and a high sensitivity especially at longer wavelengths, which makes the HSC one of the most powerful observing facilities in the world.},

abstract = {Obtaining models that capture imaging markers relevant for disease progression and treatment monitoring is challenging. Models are typically based on large amounts of data with annotated examples of known markers aiming at automating detection. High annotation effort and the limitation to a vocabulary of known markers limit the power of such approaches. Here, we perform unsupervised learning to identify anomalies in imaging data as candidates for markers. We propose AnoGAN, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to learn a manifold of normal anatomical variability, accompanying a novel anomaly scoring scheme based on the mapping from image space to a latent space. Applied to new data, the model labels anomalies, and scores image patches indicating their fit into the learned distribution. Results on optical coherence tomography images of the retina demonstrate that the approach correctly identifies anomalous images, such as images containing retinal fluid or hyperreflective foci.},

@inproceedings{Li2018,
abstract = {Today's Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are large, complex, and affixed with networked sensors and actuators that are targets for cyber-attacks. Conventional detection techniques are unable to deal with the increasingly dynamic and complex nature of the CPSs. On the other hand, the networked sensors and actuators generate large amounts of data streams that can be continuously monitored for intrusion events. Unsupervised machine learning techniques can be used to model the system behaviour and classify deviant behaviours as possible attacks. In this work, we proposed a novel Generative Adversarial Networks-based Anomaly Detection (GAN-AD) method for such complex networked CPSs. We used LSTM-RNN in our GAN to capture the distribution of the multivariate time series of the sensors and actuators under normal working conditions of a CPS. Instead of treating each sensor's and actuator's time series independently, we model the time series of multiple sensors and actuators in the CPS concurrently to take into account of potential latent interactions between them. To exploit both the generator and the discriminator of our GAN, we deployed the GAN-trained discriminator together with the residuals between generator-reconstructed data and the actual samples to detect possible anomalies in the complex CPS. We used our GAN-AD to distinguish abnormal attacked situations from normal working conditions for a complex six-stage Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. Experimental results showed that the proposed strategy is effective in identifying anomalies caused by various attacks with high detection rate and low false positive rate as compared to existing methods.},

To select Z/Z{\_}sun{\textless}0.1 EMPGs from {\~{}}40 million sources detected in the Subaru images, we first develop a machine-learning (ML) classifier based on a deep neural network algorithm with a training data set consisting of optical photometry of galaxy, star, and QSO models. We test our ML classifier with SDSS objects having spectroscopic metallicity measurements, and confirm that our ML classifier accomplishes 86{\%}-completeness and 46{\%}-purity EMPG classifications with photometric data. Applying our ML classifier to the photometric data of the Subaru sources as well as faint SDSS objects with no spectroscopic data, we obtain 27 and 86 EMPG candidates from the Subaru and SDSS photometric data, respectively. We conduct optical follow-up spectroscopy for 10 out of our EMPG candidates with Magellan/LDSS-3+MagE, Keck/DEIMOS, and Subaru/FOCAS, and find that the 10 EMPG candidates are star-forming galaxies at z=0.007-0.03 with large H{\_}beta equivalent widths of 104-265 A, stellar masses of log(M*/M{\_}sun)=5.0-7.1, and high specific star-formation rates of {\~{}}300 Gyr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}, which are similar to those of early galaxies at z{\textgreater}6 reported recently. We spectroscopically confirm that 3 out of 10 candidates are truly EMPGs with Z/Z{\_}sun{\textless}0.1, one of which is HSC J1631+4426, the most metal-poor galaxy with Z/Z{\_}sun=0.016 reported ever.},

@article{Cardamone2009,
abstract = {We investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as "Green Peas", first noted by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project because of their peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in SDSS imaging. Their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [O III] 5007 A, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to {\~{}}1000 A. We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some AGN interlopers including 8 newly discovered narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low mass galaxies (M{\~{}}10{\^{}}8.5 - 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun) with high star formation rates ({\~{}}10 M{\_}sun/yr), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 {\~{}} 8.7) and low reddening (E(B-V) {\textless} 0.25) and they reside in low density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}-8{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myrs. The few star-forming Peas with HST imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies. They are also similar to high redshift UV-luminous galaxies, e.g., Lyman-break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.},

abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to {\textless}sup{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

abstract = {We present the results from the Suzaku satellite of the surrounding region of a galaxy clus-ter, A2744, at z = 0.3. To search for oxygen emission lines from the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), we analyzed X-ray spectra from two northeast regions 2.2–3.3 and 3.3– 4.4 Mpc from the center of the cluster, which offers the first test on the presence of a WHIM near the typical accretion shock radius (∼ 2r 200) predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. For the 2.2–3.3 Mpc region, the spectral fit significantly (99.2{\%} significance) improved when we include O VII and O VIII lines in the spectral model. A comparable WHIM surface bright-ness was obtained in the 3.3–4.4 Mpc region and the redshift of O VIII line is consistent with z = 0.3 within errors. The present results support that the observed soft X-ray emission orig-inated from the WHIM. However, considering both statistical and systematic uncertainties, O VIII detection in the northeast regions was marginal. The surface brightness of the O VIII line in 10 −7 photons cm −2 s −1 arcmin −2 was measured to be 2.7 ± 1.0, 2.1 ± 1.2 for the 2.2–3.3, 3.3– 4.4 Mpc regions, giving the upper limit on the baryon overdensity of $\delta$ = 319({\textless} 443), 283({\textless} 446), respectively. This is comparable with previous observations of cluster outskirts and their the-oretical predictions. The future prospect for WHIM detection using the Athena X-IFU micro-calorimeter is briefly discussed here. In addition, we also derived the ICM temperature distri-bution of A2744 to detect a clear discontinuity at the location of the radio relic. This suggests that the cluster has undergone strong shock heating by mass accretion along the filament.},

abstract = {Wide-angle photometric surveys of previously uncharted sky areas or wavelength regimes will always bring in unexpected sources whose existence and properties cannot be easily predicted from earlier observations: novelties or even anomalies. Such objects can be efficiently sought for with novelty detection algorithms. Here we present an application of such a method, called one-class support vector machines (OCSVM), to search for anomalous patterns among sources preselected from the mid-infrared AllWISE catalogue covering the whole sky. To create a model of expected data we train the algorithm on a set of objects with spectroscopic identifications from the SDSS DR13 database, present also in AllWISE. OCSVM detects as anomalous those sources whose patterns - WISE photometric measurements in this case - are inconsistent with the model. Among the detected anomalies we find artefacts, such as objects with spurious photometry due to blending, but most importantly also real sources of genuine astrophysical interest. Among the latter, OCSVM has identified a sample of heavily reddened AGN/quasar candidates distributed uniformly over the sky and in a large part absent from other WISE-based AGN catalogues. It also allowed us to find a specific group of sources of mixed types, mostly stars and compact galaxies. By combining the semi-supervised OCSVM algorithm with standard classification methods it will be possible to improve the latter by accounting for sources which are not present in the training sample but are otherwise well-represented in the target set. Anomaly detection adds flexibility to automated source separation procedures and helps verify the reliability and representativeness of the training samples. It should be thus considered as an essential step in supervised classification schemes to ensure completeness and purity of produced catalogues.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the Universe has progressed through deliberate, targeted studies of known phenomena, like the supernova campaigns that enabled the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, as much as through serendipitous, unexpected discoveries. The discovery of the Jovian moons, and of interstellar objects like 1I/'Oumuamua forced us to rethink the framework through which we explain the Universe and develop new theories. Recent surveys, like the Catalina Realtime-Transient Survey and the Zwicky Transient Facility, and upcoming ones, like the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, explore the parameter space of astrophysical transients at all time scales, from hours to years, and offer the opportunity to discover new, unexpected phenomena. In this paper, we investigate strategies to identify novel objects and to contextualize them within large time-series data sets to facilitate the discovery of new objects, new classes of objects, and the physical interpretation of their anomalous nature. We compare tree-based and manifold-learning algorithms for anomaly detection as they are applied to a data set of light curves from the Kepler observatory that include the bona fide anomalous Boyajian's star. We assess the impact of pre-processing and feature engineering schemes and investigate the astrophysical nature of the objects that our models identify as anomalous by augmenting the Kepler data with $\backslash$emph{\{}Gaia{\}} color and luminosity information. We find that multiple models, used in combination, are a promising strategy to not only identify novel time series but also to find objects that share phenomenological and astrophysical characteristics with them, facilitating the interpretation of their anomalous characteristics.},

abstract = {High redshift quasars (HZQs) with redshifts of z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 6 are so rare that any photometrically-selected sample of sources with HZQ-like colours is likely to be dominated by Galactic stars and brown dwarfs scattered from the stellar locus. It is impractical to reobserve all such candidates, so an alternative approach was developed in which Bayesian model comparison techniques are used to calculate the probability that a candidate is a HZQ, P{\_}q, by combining models of the quasar and star populations with the photometric measurements of the object. This method was motivated specifically by the large number of HZQ candidates identified by cross-matching the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Large Area Survey (LAS) to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS): in the {\~{}}1900 deg{\^{}}2 covered by the LAS in the UKIDSS Seventh Data Release (DR7) there are {\~{}}10{\^{}}3 real astronomical point-sources with the measured colours of the target quasars, of which only {\~{}}10 are expected to be HZQs. Applying Bayesian model comparison to the sample reveals that most sources with HZQ-like colours have P{\_}q {\textless}{\~{}} 0.1 and can be confidently rejected without the need for any further observations. In the case of the UKIDSS DR7 LAS, there were just 88 candidates with P{\_}q {\textgreater}= 0.1; these object were prioritized for reobservation by ranking according to P{\_}q (and their likely redshift, which was also inferred from the photometric data). Most candidates were rejected after one or two (moderate depth) photometric measurements by recalculating P{\_}q using the new data. That left seven confirmed HZQs, three of which were previously identified in the SDSS and four of which were new UKIDSS discoveries. The high efficiency of this Bayesian selection method suggests that it could usefully be extended to other HZQ surveys (e.g. searches by Pan-STARRS or VISTA) as well as to other searches for rare objects.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is a significant and hence well-studied problem. However, developing effective anomaly detection methods for complex and high-dimensional data remains a challenge. As Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are able to model the complex high-dimensional distributions of real-world data, they offer a promising approach to address this challenge. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection method, Adversarially Learned Anomaly Detection (ALAD) based on bi-directional GANs, that derives adversarially learned features for the anomaly detection task. ALAD then uses reconstruction errors based on these adversarially learned features to determine if a data sample is anomalous. ALAD builds on recent advances to ensure data-space and latent-space cycle-consistencies and stabilize GAN training, which results in significantly improved anomaly detection performance. ALAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of image and tabular datasets while being several hundred-fold faster at test time than the only published GAN-based method.},

We present 41 new definite or probable lens candidates discovered in Data Release 2 of the survey. Using a combined sample of 87 galaxy-scale lenses out to a lens redshift of z L ∼ 0.8, we compare galaxy number counts in lines of sight toward known and newly-discovered lenses in the survey to those of a control sample consisting of random lines of sight. We also compare the local overdensity of lens galaxies to a sample of "twin" galaxies that have a similar redshift and velocity dispersion to test whether lenses lie in different environments from similar non-lens galaxies. We find that lens fields contain higher number counts of galaxies compared to the control fields, but this effect arises from the local environment of the lens. Once galaxies in the lens plane are removed, the lens lines of sight are consistent with the control sample. The local environments of the lenses are overdense compared to the control sample, and are slightly overdense compared to those of the twin sample, although the significance is marginal. There is no significant evidence of the evolution of the local overdensity of lens environments with redshift.},

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only poor samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models with continuous generators. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10 and LSUN bedrooms. †},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is a classical problem in computer vision, namely the determination of the normal from the abnormal when datasets are highly biased towards one class (normal) due to the insufficient sample size of the other class (abnormal). While this can be addressed as a supervised learning problem, a significantly more challenging problem is that of detecting the unknown/unseen anomaly case that takes us instead into the space of a one-class, semi-supervised learning paradigm. We introduce such a novel anomaly detection model, by using a conditional generative adversarial network that jointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference of latent space. Employing encoder-decoder-encoder sub-networks in the generator network enables the model to map the input image to a lower dimension vector, which is then used to reconstruct the generated output image. The use of the additional encoder network maps this generated image to its latent representation. Minimizing the distance between these images and the latent vectors during training aids in learning the data distribution for the normal samples. As a result, a larger distance metric from this learned data distribution at inference time is indicative of an outlier from that distribution—an anomaly. Experimentation over several benchmark datasets, from varying domains, shows the model efficacy and superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

Our method follows an active learning strategy where the learning algorithm chooses objects which can potentially improve the learner if additional information about them is provided. This new information is subsequently used to update the machine learning model, allowing its accuracy to evolve with each new information. For the case of anomaly detection, the algorithm aims to maximize the number of scientifically interesting anomalies presented to the expert by slightly modifying the weights of a traditional Isolation Forest (IF) at each iteration. In order to demonstrate the potential of such techniques, we apply the Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) algorithm to 2 data sets: simulated light curves from the PLAsTiCC challenge and real light curves from the Open Supernova Catalog. We compare the AAD results to those of a static IF. For both methods, we performed a detailed analysis for all objects with the {\~{}}2{\%} highest anomaly scores.

As survey astronomy continues to grow, the size and complexity of astronomical data bases will increase, and the ability of astronomers to manually scour data and make such discoveries decreases. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based method to identify anomalies in large data sets to facilitate such discoveries, and apply this method to long cadence light curves from NASA's Kepler Mission. Our method clusters data based on density, identifying anomalies as data that lie outside of dense regions. This work serves as a proof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the Kepler long cadence light curves. We use Kepler's most notorious anomaly, Boyajian's star (KIC 8462852), as a rare ‘ground truth' for testing outlier identification to verify that objects of genuine scientific interest are included among the identified anomalies. We evaluate the method's ability to identify known anomalies by identifying unusual behaviour in Boyajian's star; we report the full list of identified anomalies for these quarters, and present a sample subset of identified outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects that are rare in the Kepler field, and data artefacts. By identifying {\textless}4 per cent of each quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection method can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel phenomena.},

abstract = {We present two statistical techniques for astronomical problems: a star-galaxy separator for the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) and a novel anomaly detection method for cross-matched astronomical datasets. The star-galaxy separator is a statistical classification method which outputs class membership probabilities rather than class labels and allows the use of prior knowledge about the source populations. Deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data from the multiply imaged Stripe 82 region are used to check the results from our classifier, which compares favourably with the UKIDSS pipeline classification algorithm. The anomaly detection method addresses the problem posed by objects having different sets of recorded variables in cross-matched datasets. This prevents the use of methods unable to handle missing values and makes direct comparison between objects difficult. For each source, our method computes anomaly scores in subspaces of the observed feature space and combines them to an overall anomaly score. The proposed technique is very general and can easily be used in applications other than astronomy. The properties and performance of our method are investigated using both real and simulated datasets.},

abstract = {In the upcoming decade large astronomical surveys will discover millions of transients raising unprecedented data challenges in the process. Only the use of the machine learning algorithms can process such large data volumes. Most of the discovered transients will belong to the known classes of astronomical objects. However, it is expected that some transients will be rare or completely new events of unknown physical nature. The task of finding them can be framed as an anomaly detection problem. In this work, we perform for the first time an automated anomaly detection analysis in the photometric data of the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), which serves as a proof of concept for the applicability of these methods to future large scale surveys. The analysis consists of the following steps: 1) data selection from the OSC and approximation of the pre-processed data with Gaussian processes, 2) dimensionality reduction, 3) searching for outliers with the use of the isolation forest algorithm, 4) expert analysis of the identified outliers. The pipeline returned 81 candidate anomalies, 27 (33{\%}) of which were confirmed to be from astrophysically peculiar objects. Found anomalies correspond to a selected sample of 1.4{\%} of the initial automatically identified data sample of ∼2000 objects. Among the identified outliers we recognised superluminous supernovae, non-classical Type Ia supernovae, unusual Type II supernovae, one active galactic nucleus and one binary microlensing event. We also found that 16 anomalies classified as supernovae in the literature are likely to be quasars or stars. Our proposed pipeline represents an effective strategy to guarantee we shall not overlook exciting new science hidden in the data we fought so hard to acquire. All code and products of this investigation are made publicly available ‡.},

abstract = {We investigate the physical nature of blue cores in early-type galaxies through the first multi-wavelength analysis of a serendipitously discovered field blue-nucleated spheroid in the background of the deep ACS/WFC griz multicolor observations of the cluster Abell 1689. The resolved g − r, r − i and i − z color maps reveal a prominent blue core identifying this galaxy as a "typical" case study, exhibiting variations of 0.5 − 1.0 mag in color between the center and the outer regions, opposite to the expectations of reddened metallicity induced gradients in passively evolved ellipticals. From a Magellan-Clay spectrum we secure the galaxy redshift at z = 0.624. We find a strong X-ray source coincident with the spheroid galaxy. Spectral features and a high X-ray luminosity indicate the presence of an AGN in the galaxy. However, a comparison of the X-ray luminosity to a sample derived from the Chandra Deep Field South displays L X to be comparable to Type I/QSO galaxies while the optical flux is consistent with a normal star-forming galaxy. We conclude that the galaxy's non-thermal component dominates at high-energy wavelengths while we associate the spheroid blue light with the stellar spectrum of normal star-forming galaxies. We argue about a probable association between the presence of blue cores in spheroids and AGN activity.},

We present an outlier detection algorithm that we developed, based on an unsupervised Random Forest. We test the algorithm on more than two million galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and examine the 400 galaxies with the highest outlier score. We find objects which have extreme emission line ratios and abnormally strong absorption lines, objects with unusual continua, including extremely reddened galaxies. We find galaxy-galaxy gravitational lenses, double-peaked emission line galaxies, and close galaxy pairs. We find galaxies with high ionisation lines, galaxies which host supernovae, and galaxies with unusual gas kinematics. Only a fraction of the outliers we find were reported by previous studies that used specific and tailored algorithms to find a single class of unusual objects. Our algorithm is general and detects all of these classes, and many more, regardless of what makes them peculiar. It can be executed on imaging, time-series, and other spectroscopic data, operates well with thousands of features, is not sensitive to missing values, and is easily parallelisable.},

abstract = {We present a new, and we believe arguably correct, algorithm for producing Red-Green-Blue (RBG) composites from 3-band astronomical images. Our method ensures that an object with a specified astronomical color (e.g. g − r and r − i) has a unique color in the RGB image, as opposed to the burnt-out white stars to which we are accustomed. A natural consequence of this is that we can use the same colors to code color-magnitude diagrams, providing a natural 'index' to our images. We also introduce the use of an asinh stretch, which allows us to show faint objects while simultaneously preserving the structure of brighter objects in the field, such as the spiral arms of large galaxies. We believe that, in addition to their aesthetic value, our images convey far more information than do the traditional ones, and provide examples from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging, the Hubble Deep Field (HDF), and Chandra to support our claims.

We have grouped state-of-the-art research techniques into different categories based on the underlying assumptions and approach adopted. Within each category we outline the basic anomaly detection technique, along with its variants and present key assumptions, to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior.

Of these, six have outflow components with emission line ratios consistent with AGN ionization. Although black holes have been known to populate the centers of at least a few dwarf galaxies, and indirect evidence of AGN quenching of star formation in dwarfs has begun to surface, our measurements constitute the first direct detection and measurement of AGN impact on the large scale kinematics and gas content in dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we find evidence suggestive of ongoing star formation suppression, possibly regulated by the AGN. Galaxy formation models must therefore be able to account not only for the formation and growth of black holes at the centers of dwarf galaxies, but should also be revised to include AGN as important -- and perhaps dominant -- sources of feedback in low mass galaxies},

abstract = {Collisions and interactions between gas-rich galaxies are thought to be pivotal stages in their formation and evolution, causing the rapid production of new stars, and possibly serving as a mechanism for fueling supermassive black holes (BH). Harnessing the exquisite spatial resolution (∼0.5 arcsec) afforded by the first ∼170 deg 2 of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, we present our new constraints on the importance of galaxy-galaxy major mergers (1:4) in growing BHs throughout the last ∼8 Gyrs. Utilizing mid-infrared observations in the WISE All-Sky survey, we robustly select active galactic nuclei (AGN) and mass-matched control galaxy samples, totaling ∼140,000 spectroscopically confirmed systems at i {\textless} 22 mag. We identify galaxy interaction signatures using a novel machine-learning random forest decision tree technique allowing us to select statistically significant samples of major-mergers, minor-mergers/irregular-systems, and non-interacting galaxies. We use these samples to show that galaxies undergoing mergers are a factor ∼ 2 − 7 more likely to contain luminous obscured AGN than non-interacting galaxies, and this is independent of both stellar mass and redshift to z {\textless} 0.9. Furthermore, based on our comparison of AGN fractions in mass-matched samples, we determine that the most luminous AGN population (L AGN 10 45 erg s −1) systematically reside in merging systems over non-interacting galaxies. Our findings show that galaxy-galaxy interactions do, on average, trigger luminous AGN activity substantially more often than in secularly evolving non-interacting galaxies, and we further suggest that the BH growth rate may be closely tied to the dynamical time of the merger system.},

abstract = {Survey telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Square Kilometre Array will discover billions of static and dynamic astronomical sources. Properly mined, these enormous datasets will likely be wellsprings of rare or unknown astrophysical phenomena. The challenge is that the datasets are so large that most data will never be seen by human eyes; currently the most robust instrument we have to detect relevant anomalies. Machine learning is a useful tool for anomaly detection in this regime. However, it struggles to distinguish between interesting anomalies and irrelevant data such as instrumental artefacts or rare astronomical sources that are simply not of interest to a particular scientist. Active learning combines the flexibility and intuition of the human brain with the raw processing power of machine learning. By strategically choosing specific objects for expert labelling, it minimises the amount of data that scientists have to look through while maximising potential scientific return. Here we introduce Astronomaly: a general anomaly detection framework with a novel active learning approach designed to provide personalised recommendations. Astronomaly can operate on most types of astronomical data, including images, light curves and spectra. We use the Galaxy Zoo dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of Astronomaly, as well as simulated data to thoroughly test our new active learning approach. We find that for both datasets, Astronomaly roughly doubles the number of interesting anomalies found in the first 100 objects viewed by the user. Astronomaly is easily extendable to include new feature extraction techniques, anomaly detection algorithms and even different active learning approaches.

The catalog covers an area of 136.9 deg 2 split into six fields, with a mean i-band seeing of 0.58 ′′ and 5$\sigma$ point-source depth of i ∼ 26. Given conservative galaxy selection criteria for first year science, the depth and excellent image quality results in unweighted and weighted source number densities of 24.6 and 21.8 arcmin −2 , respectively. We define the requirements for cosmological weak lensing science with this catalog, then focus on characterizing potential systematics in the catalog using a series of internal null tests for problems with point-spread function (PSF) modeling, shear estimation, and other aspects of the image processing. We find that the PSF models narrowly meet requirements for weak lens-ing science with this catalog, with fractional PSF model size residuals of approximately 0.003 (requirement: 0.004) and the PSF model shape correlation function $\rho$ 1 {\textless} 3 × 10 −7 (requirement: 4 × 10 −7) at 0.5 • scales. A variety of galaxy shape-related null tests are statistically consistent with zero, but star-galaxy shape correlations reveal additive systematics on on {\textgreater} 1 • scales that are sufficiently large as to require mitigation in cosmic shear measurements. Finally, we discuss the dominant systematics and the planned algorithmic changes to reduce them in future data reductions.},
